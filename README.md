Throughout my internship period, I have taken many tasks individually. 
One of them is understanding of basic conseps of Uart communication protocol and testing it using FPGA. This project consists of two parts;
One part is sending data from computer to FPGA to blink led.
The other part is sending data from FPGA to computer to see in serial monitor.
